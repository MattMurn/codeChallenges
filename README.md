# codeChallenges
A combo with completed CodeWars and HackerRank challenges and unit tests.

## Purpose

### It will be fun to track performance / progess and change in syntax and readability.

## Run it

### If you have Node.js installed,  all you need to do is run npm install / yarn to install jest, but this is not really necessary as these are singular.
